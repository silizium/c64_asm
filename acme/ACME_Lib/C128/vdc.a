; color codes

; These are the colors officially available on the C128 - the same names as if using a C64's VIC, but different codes of course.

; color name           RGBI code
vdcclr_black	= $0; %....
vdcclr_white	= $f; %####
vdcclr_red	= $8; %#...
vdcclr_cyan	= $7; %.###

vdcclr_green	= $4; %.#..
vdcclr_blue	= $2; %..#.
vdcclr_yellow	= $d; %##.#
vdcclr_orange	= $a; %#.#. (this is in fact a dark shade of purple)
vdcclr_brown	= $c; %##..
vdcclr_lred	= $9; %#..#
vdcclr_gray1	= $6; %.##. (this is in fact a dark shade of cyan)
vdcclr_gray2	= $1; %...# (this is almost, but not quite, entirely black)
vdcclr_lgreen	= $5; %.#.#
vdcclr_lblue	= $3; %..##
vdcclr_gray3	= $e; %###.

; The following alternative names are much easier to remember when you're used to writing programs for the VDC: There are eight main colors, and each one is available in a light and a dark shade - even "black" and "white" !

; primary colors   RGBI code

vdcclr_lwhite	= %####

; if you don't like the concept of shaded black/white, then use these:

; gray level       RGBI code
vdcclr_black	= %....; "dark black"  => "black"
vdcclr_dgray	= %...#; "light black" => "dark grey"
vdcclr_lgray	= %###.; "dark white"  => "light grey"
vdcclr_white	= %####; "light white" => "white"

; attribute flags (2rufRGBI)
