         ...the ACME Crossassembler for Multiple Environments

                 --- the example source code file ---


To assemble the given example source code file, change to the
"example" directory and type

    acme -v3 MacEdit.a

The "-v3" option sets the verbose mode to level 3, producing some more
informational output.
ACME will parse the source code files and will then produce a file
called "MacEdit7.o". You may compare that file to the file called
"Expected" to make sure ACME works as it should do.

Just in case you wonder: "MacEdit" is an unusably bad text editor for
the C128.
